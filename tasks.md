- [ ] HTTP endpoint to RabbitMQ message translation
- [ ] JWT authentication middleware
- [ ] Request validation and transformation
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation
- [ ] Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

**Required Endpoints**:

- [ ] `POST /auth/login` ‚Üí `auth.login`
- [ ] `POST /auth/register` ‚Üí `auth.register`
- [ ] `GET /auth/profile` ‚Üí `auth.get_profile`
- [ ] `POST /auth/refresh` ‚Üí `auth.refresh_token`

## üìù Current Development Tasks

### üî• High Priority (Next Sprint)

1. **Complete API Gateway Setup**
   - [ ] HTTP endpoints for auth operations
   - [ ] JWT middleware implementation
   - [ ] Request/response validation
   - [ ] Error handling and logging

2. **JWT Authentication System**
   - [ ] Proper JWT signing and validation
   - [ ] Refresh token mechanism
   - [ ] Token expiration handling
   - [ ] Blacklist/revocation system

3. **Password Security**
   - [ ] bcrypt password hashing
   - [ ] Password strength validation
   - [ ] Password reset functionality
   - [ ] Account lockout protection

### üöß Medium Priority

4. **Project Service Foundation**
   - [ ] Database schema design
