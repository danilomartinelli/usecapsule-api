# Capsule Platform

> **Cloud-native application deployment platform that eliminates infrastructure complexity for development teams**

Capsule transforms the way teams deploy and manage applications by providing automated deployment pipelines, comprehensive observability, and zero vendor lock-in through Infrastructure as Code export capabilities. Built on Kubernetes with a developer-first approach, Capsule reduces deployment time from weeks to minutes while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability and security.

## üéØ Why Capsule?

Development teams spend 40-60% of their time wrestling with infrastructure instead of building features. Capsule solves this by abstracting away infrastructure complexity while maintaining the flexibility and control teams need. With Capsule, you can deploy any application with a simple git push, monitor it with built-in observability tools, and export your entire infrastructure as code whenever you need to migrate or go independent.

### Key Features

- **Universal Smart Deploy** - Automatically detects and deploys 50+ frameworks with zero configuration
- **Complete Observability** - Metrics, logging, and distributed tracing out of the box
- **Team Collaboration** - Preview environments for every pull request with automatic cleanup
- **No Lock-in** - Export to Kubernetes, Terraform, or Docker Compose at any time
- **Managed Services** - Production-ready databases and message brokers with one click

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:

- **Node.js** (v20 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (v10 or higher) - Comes with Node.js
- **Docker Desktop** - [Download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- **Git** - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)

Optional but recommended:

- **Nx Console** - VS Code extension for better Nx experience
- **PostgreSQL client** - For database debugging (psql or pgAdmin)
- **RabbitMQ Management** - Access at <http://localhost:15672> when running

### Quick Start

Follow these steps to get Capsule running on your local machine in under 5 minutes:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/capsule.git
cd capsule

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start infrastructure (databases, RabbitMQ)
npm run infrastructure:up

# Run database migrations
npm run db:migrate:all

# Start all services in development mode
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run the API Gateway
npm run serve:gateway
```

Your Capsule platform is now running! Access it at:

- **API Gateway**: <http://localhost:3000>
- **API Documentation**: <http://localhost:3000/api/documentation>
- **RabbitMQ Management**: <http://localhost:7020> (usecapsule/usecapsule_dev_password)

### Verifying Your Setup

Run the health check to ensure everything is working:

```bash
# Check all services are healthy
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Check service health
curl http://localhost:3000/health/ready
```

## üìÅ Project Structure

Capsule uses an Nx monorepo structure with Domain-Driven Design principles. Each microservice represents a bounded context with its own database and domain model:

```text

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Working with Nx

Nx provides powerful tools for monorepo management. Here are the essential commands you'll use daily:

```bash
# Serve a specific application
nx serve api-gateway
nx serve auth-service --watch

# Build a specific application
nx build auth-service

# Lint a specific project
nx lint auth-service

# Generate new code
nx g @nx/nest:module user --project=auth-service
nx g @nx/nest:service user --project=auth-service

# See project dependencies
nx graph

# Run commands for all affected projects
nx affected:build
nx affected:lint
```

### Available Scripts

We've created convenient npm scripts that orchestrate common development tasks:

#### Infrastructure Management

```bash
npm run infrastructure:up      # Start Docker containers (databases, RabbitMQ)
npm run infrastructure:down    # Stop all containers
npm run infrastructure:reset   # Reset all data (careful!)
```

#### Database Management

```bash
npm run db:migrate:all        # Run all service migrations
npm run db:migrate:auth       # Run auth service migrations only
npm run db:migrate:deploy     # Run deploy service migrations only
npm run db:seed:all          # Seed all databases with test data
npm run db:reset:all         # Drop and recreate all databases
```

#### Development

```bash
npm run dev                  # Start all services in watch mode
npm run dev:gateway         # Start only API Gateway
npm run dev:services        # Start all microservices (no gateway)
npm run build              # Build all projects
npm run build:affected     # Build only changed projects
```

#### Code Quality

```bash
npm run lint              # Lint all projects
npm run lint:affected     # Lint only changed code
npm run format           # Format code with Prettier
npm run analyze          # Analyze bundle sizes
```

### Creating a New Microservice

When you need to add a new bounded context to the system, follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Generate the new service
nx g @nx/nest:app payment-service

# 2. Create the database configuration
mkdir apps/payment-service/migrations
touch apps/payment-service/migrations/flyway.conf

# 3. Add the service to docker-compose.yml
# (Copy the pattern from auth-service)

# 4. Create the first migration
echo "CREATE TABLE payments (...);" > \
  apps/payment-service/migrations/V1__create_payments_table.sql

# 5. Add message handlers (no HTTP controllers!)
nx g @nx/nest:controller message-handlers/payment \
  --project=payment-service

# 6. Connect to RabbitMQ in main.ts
# (Copy pattern from auth-service/src/main.ts)
```

### Working with Databases

Each microservice has its own database. Here's how to interact with them during development:

```bash
# Connect to a specific service's database
docker exec -it capsule-auth-db psql -U auth_user -d auth_service_db
docker exec -it capsule-deploy-db psql -U deploy_user -d deploy_service_db

# View migration history
docker run --rm --network=host \
  -v ./apps/auth-service/migrations:/flyway/sql \
  flyway/flyway:9 info \
  -url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/auth_service_db \
  -user=auth_user -password=auth_pass

# Create a new migration
touch apps/auth-service/migrations/V$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M)__description.sql
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Capsule follows Domain-Driven Design with Hexagonal Architecture patterns:

- **API Gateway Pattern**: Single HTTP entry point that routes to microservices via RabbitMQ
- **Database per Service**: Each bounded context owns its data completely
- **CQRS**: Commands and queries separate write and read operations
- **Event-Driven**: Services communicate asynchronously through domain events
- **No Shared State**: Services never share databases or domain models

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Message-Only Microservices**: Services only communicate via RabbitMQ, never HTTP
2. **Flyway Migrations**: Schema versioning with forward-only migrations
3. **Domain-First Development**: Business logic lives in domain entities, not services
4. **Eventual Consistency**: Embracing async communication between bounded contexts

For deep dives into our architecture patterns, refer to [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md).

## üîç Code Quality

We maintain high code quality through comprehensive linting and formatting:

### Code Analysis

```bash
# Lint code for style and errors
nx lint auth-service --watch

# Format code with Prettier
nx format:write

# Type checking
nx typecheck auth-service

# Check all affected projects
nx affected:lint
```

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

Our GitHub Actions pipeline ensures code quality and automates deployments:

```yaml
# On every push
- Lint affected code
- Build affected projects
- Type checking

# On PR to main
- Full lint and format check
- Build all projects
- Security scanning

# On merge to main
- Run Flyway migrations
- Deploy to staging
- Health checks
- Deploy to production (manual approval)
```

## üìä Monitoring and Debugging

### Local Debugging

```bash
# View logs for a specific service
docker logs -f capsule-auth-service

# Access RabbitMQ Management UI
open http://localhost:7020

# Monitor database queries
docker exec capsule-auth-db psql -U auth_user -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;"

# Debug with VS Code
# 1. Run: nx serve auth-service --inspect
# 2. Attach debugger to port 9229
```

### Performance Profiling

```bash
# Generate CPU profile
nx serve auth-service --inspect-brk
# Use Chrome DevTools to profile

# Analyze bundle size
nx build auth-service --stats-json
webpack-bundle-analyzer dist/apps/auth-service/stats.json
```
